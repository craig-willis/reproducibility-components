## 2019-07-17 Identify concepts in FASEB and NAS definitions

### Background
- The starting point for this project is a comparison of the definitions of *reproducibility* and *replicability* recommended by FASEB and the National Academy of Sciences.
- Here we identify the key terms used in these definitions, and attempt to infer what combinations of words refer to the critical concepts underlying the definitions.
- A future step will be try to map between the respective terms and concepts.

### Terms and concepts in the FASEB recommendations
- Found definitions of *reproducibility*, *replicability*, and *transparency* in [*Enhancing Research Reproducibility: Recommendations from the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology* (FASEB, 2016)](https://www.faseb.org/Portals/2/PDFs/opa/2016/FASEB_Enhancing%20Research%20Reproducibility.pdf).
- Copied the definitions to the whiteboard below, and extracted nouns, verbs, modifiers and important combinations of these:

* The extracted terms and concepts are:

### Terms and concepts in the NAS recommendations
- Found definitions of *reproducibility* and *replicability* (there is no explicit definition of *transparency*) in [*Reproducibility and Replicability in Science* (NAS, 2019)](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25303/reproducibility-and-replicability-in-science).
- Copied the definitions to the whiteboard below, and extracted nouns, verbs, modifiers and important combinations of these:
