## 2019-07-17 Identify concepts in FASEB and NAS definitions

### Background
- The starting point for this project is a comparison of the definitions of *reproducibility* and *replicability* recommended by FASEB and the National Academy of Sciences.
- Here we identify the key terms used in these definitions, and attempt to infer what combinations of words refer to the critical concepts underlying the definitions.
- A future step will be try to map between the respective terms and concepts.
