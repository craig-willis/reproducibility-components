# reproducibility-components
This repository represents work towards discovering the fundamental components of scientific reproducibility reflected in the many---often conflicting---definitions of terms such as *reproducibility*, *replicability*, *repeatability*, *reusability*, etc in the scientific literature.  The aim is to enable research communities to employ these terms in ways most useful to practitioners in each field, while providing unambiguous means of translating between  potentially conflicting terminologies.

The paper, [Reproducibility by Other Means: Transparent Research Objects (McPhillips & Ludaescher, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3270559) provides a background for this effort.  The LaTeX sources for this paper may be found in the [ro2019](https://github.com/tmcphillips/reproducibility-components/tree/master/ro2019) subdirectory of this repository.
