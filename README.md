The [ro2019](https://github.com/tmcphillips/reproducibility-components/tree/master/ro2019) subdirectory contains a paper submitted to Research Objects 2019 providing the background for this effort.  The latest revision of the paper can be found on Zenodo:  [Reproducibility by Other Means: Transparent Research Objects (McPhillips & Ludaescher, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3270559).
